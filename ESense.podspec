  s.description      = <<-DESC
 [eSense](http://www.esense.io/) is a multi-sensory earable platform for personal-scale behavioural analytics research. It is a True Wireless Stereo (TWS) earbud augmented with a 6-axis inertial motion unit, a microphone, and dual-mode Bluetooth (Bluetooth Classic and Bluetooth Low Energy). This library allows us to easily connect and communicate eSense on iOS.
